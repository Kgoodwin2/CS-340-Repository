Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements I tried to address were creating a user login/sign up page. Allowing users to see database information in a grid layout, the database contained sample inventory information for assignment purposes. This application was designed to address simple inventory database needs.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The UI necessary to make user experience efficient was a single login screen, that then transitions into a database display screen upoon successful login. My goal here was the more simple the better. Information from the database alone will begin to crowd the screen of the app so clean was best to start with.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I tried to approach coding the application one activity step at a time. Since I am so new with Android Studio, I often found myself finding new resources that gave me ideas on how to improve my application, which complicated things. I hope that in the future once I get more proficient with the app, that this becomes easier for me.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I ran my code per activity, but ran into a ton of issues. The first was a liscense acceptance issue with the SDK package, then just issues transitioning into the next activity. Testing as you go is so critical because if you catch errors late it is so hard to fix them.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think I did best on the login screen, only because I had the most time to work on it.
